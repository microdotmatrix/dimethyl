###### I am an artist and content creator who loves making paintings, drawings, accessories, and apparel. You can also find me streaming games, fitness, and art sessions live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ggslayley).

The works I make can be categorized somewhere in between Abstract Expressionism and Psychedelia. Creating new work is often channeled through a purging of my emotions; it is a raw act of self expression- a form of visual catharsis, if you will. The human condition influences my imagery, and is represented through emotion, symbols, and patterns. I sense synchronicity and a reciprocal oneness within the universe and humankind as a whole, and that feeling is what inspires me to create.

A portion of my work can also be viewed under ultraviolet light, often times revealing something new to the viewer that was not apparent in visible light. This concept addresses the dichotomy of an idea we may initially perceive at face value, and shows the viewer a new perspective, only after shining a new light on the matter.
