### The music and performing arts event of the century comes to Springfield for one day only!

See bands like Nine Inch Nails, Cypress Hill, The Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, and even Peter Frampton's old ass trying to stay relevant. Jim Rose's traveling Freak Show will be performing feats to astound all, and best of all, will feature Springfield's own Homer Simpson taking a cannon ball to the gut!
